#Supervised ML:
        
        Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is one that has both input and output parameters. In this type of learning both training and validation, datasets are labelled.
Linear regression is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and is typically leveraged to make predictions about future outcomes. For each type of linear regression, it seeks to plot a line of best fit, which is calculated through the method of least squares. However, unlike other regression models, this line is straight when plotted on a graph.
